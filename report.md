We have wagered a total of €43,651 and made a betting profit of €3,891,
which gives us a betting ROI of 8.91%.

bookie profits (pts)

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 735 points and losses of 645 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 645 / 735 = 0.88 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, places and non-runners
we’ve bet on.

| result         |   n | percent |
| :------------- | --: | :------ |
| Win only Lose  | 256 | 64%     |
| Win only Win   |  76 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose  |  55 | 14%     |
| Each way Place |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win   |   6 | 1%      |

# Win only vs each way

  - We’ve made 306 *win only* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €5,411.
  - We’ve made 64 *each way* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €-1,520.
