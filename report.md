# ROI and ROC

We put in €9000 and we’ve made a profit of €4,092 on the bets. However,
we’ve paid two subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €1,345 so our net
profit is €2,747. That’s a return on capital of 30.52%.

We have wagered a total of €46,210 and made a betting profit of €4,092,
which gives us a betting ROI of 8.86%.

bookie profits (pts)

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 771 points and losses of 676 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 676 / 771 = 0.88 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result         |   n | percent |

| Win only Win   |  80 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose  |  57 | 13%     |
| Each way Place |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win   |   6 | 1%      |
