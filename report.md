# ROI and ROC

We put in €9000 and we’ve made a profit of €3,815 on the bets. However,
we’ve paid three subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €2,036 so our
net profit is €1,779. That’s a return on capital of 19.77%. This gives
us a current bank of €10779.

We have wagered a total of €101,398 and made a betting profit of €3,815,
which gives us a betting ROI of 3.76%.

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 1373 points and losses of 1280 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 1280 / 1373 = 0.93 of what we actually
got, we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result                  |   n | percent |
| :---------------------- | --: | :------ |
| Win only Lose           | 901 | 69%     |
| Win only Win            | 181 | 14%     |
| Each way Lose           | 108 | 8%      |
| Win only Unmatched Loss |  44 | 3%      |
| Each way Place          |  37 | 3%      |
| Each way Win            |  19 | 1%      |
| Win only Unmatched Win  |  12 | 1%      |
| Each way Unmatched Loss |   1 | 0%      |
| Win only Place          |   1 | 0%      |

# Win only vs each way

  - We’ve made 732 *win only* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €3,652.
  - We’ve made 112 *each way* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €163.

# Unmatched Bets

We’ll consider only win only bets (and not each way bets) in this
section.

Of the bets that have been matched, there have been 125 winners and 546
losers. That means that 19% of matched bets have been winners. Of the
bets that have not been matched, there have been 12 winners and 44
losers. That means that 21% of unmatched bets have been winners.
Unmatched bets have saved us 43 points on losers but cost us 77 on
winners, whereas getting better odds on posted bets which were matched
has made us 44 points (where I have assumed that when we post, we get
20% better odds than if we’d just taken best available at the time). So
overall, unmatched bets have saved us 10 points.
