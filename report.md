# ROI and ROC

We put in €9000 and we’ve made a profit of €4,998 on the bets. However,
we’ve paid three subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €2,050 so our
net profit is €2,948. That’s a return on capital of 32.76%.

We have wagered a total of €50,257 and made a betting profit of €4,998,
which gives us a betting ROI of 9.94%.

bookie profits (pts)

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 845 points and losses of 732 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 732 / 845 = 0.87 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result         |   n | percent |
| :------------- | --: | :------ |

| Win only Win   |  92 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose  |  61 | 13%     |
| Each way Place |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win   |   9 | 2%      |
| Win only um    |   2 | 0%      |
