bookie profits (pts)

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 762 points and losses of 670 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 670 / 762 = 0.88 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result         |   n | percent |
| :------------- | --: | :------ |
| Win only Lose  | 268 | 63%     |
| Win only Win   |  79 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose  |  57 | 13%     |
| Each way Place |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win   |   6 | 1%      |
| Win only NA    |   5 | 1%      |

# Win only vs each way

  - We’ve made 325 *win only* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €5,796.
  - We’ve made 67 *each way* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €-1,827.
