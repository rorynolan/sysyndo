# ROI and ROC



We put in €9000 and we've made a profit of €9,863 on the bets. However, we've paid three subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €1,941 so our net profit is €7,922. That's a return on capital of 88.02%. This gives us a current bank of €16922.

We have wagered a total of €114,388 and made a betting profit of €9,863, which gives us a betting ROI of 8.62%.

# Minimum acceptable odds



We've had winnings of 1698 points and losses of 1498 points, so even if our odds were only a fraction 1498 / 1698 = 0.88 of what we actually got, we'd still be breaking even.


# Winners and losers

Here's a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we've had.


|result                  |    n|percent |
|:-----------------------|----:|:-------|
|Win only Lose           | 1207|71%     |
|Win only Win            |  242|14%     |
|Each way Lose           |  117|7%      |
|Win only Unmatched Loss |   63|4%      |
|Each way Place          |   40|2%      |
|Each way Win            |   20|1%      |
|Win only Unmatched Win  |   13|1%      |
|Each way Unmatched Loss |    1|0%      |


# Win only vs each way



* We've made 842 _win only_ bets, on which we've made a profit of €9,063. 
* We've made 108 _each way_ bets, on which we've made a profit of €800.


# Unmatched Bets



We'll consider only win only bets (and not each way bets) in this section.

Of the bets that have been matched, there have been 152 winners and 677 losers. That means that 18% of matched bets have been winners. Of the bets that have not been matched, there have been 13 winners and 63 losers. That means that 17% of unmatched bets have been winners. Unmatched bets have saved us 64 points on losers but cost us 81 on winners, whereas getting better odds on posted bets which were matched has made us 71 points (where I have assumed that when we post, we get 20% better odds than if we'd just taken best available at the time). So overall, choosing to post when we do (rather than taking the bad bbest available odds) has saved us 54 points.


# Summary



We've made a gross profit of €9,863 and paid €3,235 in subscription fees, so our net profit is €6,628.

* Rory has a 44% share of the investment, therefore his net profit is €2,946.
* Aidan has a 44% share of the investment, therefore his net profit is €2,946.
* John has a 11% share of the investment, therefore his net profit is €736.
