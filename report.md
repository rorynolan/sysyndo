# ROI and ROC

profit is €2,408. That’s a return on capital of 26.76%.

We have wagered a total of €49,404 and made a betting profit of €3,776,
which gives us a betting ROI of 7.64%.

bookie profits (pts)

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 815 points and losses of 727 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 727 / 815 = 0.89 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result         |   n | percent |

| Win only Win   |  86 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose  |  61 | 13%     |
| Each way Place |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win   |   9 | 2%      |

    €5,245.
