# ROI and ROC

We put in €9000 and we’ve made a profit of €3,825 on the bets. However,
we’ve paid three subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €2,068 so our
net profit is €1,757. That’s a return on capital of 19.52%. This gives
us a current bank of €10757.

We have wagered a total of €56,666 and made a betting profit of €3,825,
which gives us a betting ROI of 6.75%.

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 892 points and losses of 799 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 799 / 892 = 0.9 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result                  |   n | percent |
| :---------------------- | --: | :------ |
| Win only Lose           | 340 | 64%     |
| Win only Win            | 100 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose           |  65 | 12%     |
| Each way Place          |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win            |   9 | 2%      |
| Win only Unmatched Loss |   8 | 1%      |
| Win only Unmatched Win  |   4 | 1%      |

# Win only vs each way

  - We’ve made 405 *win only* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €5,578.
  - We’ve made 75 *each way* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €-1,753.

# Unmatched Bets

We’ll consider only win only bets (and not each way bets) in this
section.

Of the bets that have been matched, there have been 81 winners and 288
losers. That means that 22% of matched bets have been winners. Of the
bets that have not been matched, there have been 4 winners and 8 losers.
That means that 33% of unmatched bets have been winners. Unmatched bets
have saved us 11 points on losers but cost us 42 on winners, whereas
getting better odds on posted bets which were matched has made us 4
points (where I have assumed that when we post, we get 20% better odds
than if we’d just taken best available at the time). So overall,
unmatched bets have cost us 27 points.
