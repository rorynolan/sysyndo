# ROI and ROC

We put in €9000 and we’ve made a profit of €3,659 on the bets. However,
we’ve paid three subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €2,057 so our
net profit is €1,602. That’s a return on capital of 17.8%. This gives us
a current bank of €10602.

We have wagered a total of €56,006 and made a betting profit of €3,659,
which gives us a betting ROI of 6.53%.

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 881 points and losses of 791 points, so even if
our odds were only a fraction 791 / 881 = 0.9 of what we actually got,
we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we’ve had.

| result                  |   n | percent |
| :---------------------- | --: | :------ |
| Win only Lose           | 332 | 63%     |
| Win only Win            |  98 | 19%     |
| Each way Lose           |  65 | 12%     |
| Each way Place          |   9 | 2%      |
| Each way Win            |   9 | 2%      |
| Win only Unmatched Loss |   8 | 2%      |
| Win only Unmatched Win  |   4 | 1%      |

# Win only vs each way

  - We’ve made 400 *win only* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €5,410.
  - We’ve made 75 *each way* bets, on which we’ve made a profit of
    €-1,751.

# Unmatched Bets

We’ll consider only win only bets (and not each way bets) in this
section.

Of the bets that have been matched, there have been 80 winners and 284
losers. That means that 22% of matched bets have been winners. Of the
bets that have not been matched, there have been 4 winners and 8 losers.
That means that 33% of unmatched bets have been winners. Unmatched bets
have saved us 11 points on losers but cost us 52 on winners, so overall
unmatched bets have cost us 41 points.
