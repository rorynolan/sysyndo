# ROI and ROC

We put in €9000 and we’ve made a profit of €3,865 on the bets. However,
we’ve paid two subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €1,345 so our net
profit is €2,520. That’s a return on capital of 28%.

We have wagered a total of €43,164 and made a betting profit of €3,865,
which gives us a betting ROI of 8.95%.

bookie profits (pts)

# Minimum acceptable odds

We’ve had winnings of 727.27 points and losses of 637.34 points, so even
if our odds were only a fraction 637.34 / 727.27 = 0.88 of what we
actually got, we’d still be breaking even.

# Winners and losers

Here’s a count of the number of winners, losers, places and non-runners
we’ve bet on.
