# ROI and ROC



We put in €9000 and we've made a profit of €NA on the bets. However, we've paid three subscriptions of £600 which amounts to €1,985 so our net profit is €NA. That's a return on capital of NA%. This gives us a current bank of €NA.

We have wagered a total of €117,865 and made a betting profit of €NA, which gives us a betting ROI of NA%.

# Minimum acceptable odds



We've had winnings of 1770 points and losses of 1531 points, so even if our odds were only a fraction 1531 / 1770 = 0.86 of what we actually got, we'd still be breaking even.


# Winners and losers

Here's a count of the number of winners, losers, and places we've had.


|result                  |    n|percent |
|:-----------------------|----:|:-------|
|Win only Lose           | 1235|71%     |
|Win only Win            |  253|14%     |
|Each way Lose           |  121|7%      |
|Win only Unmatched Loss |   67|4%      |
|Each way Place          |   40|2%      |
|Each way Win            |   20|1%      |
|Win only Unmatched Win  |   14|1%      |
|Each way Unmatched Loss |    1|0%      |


# Win only vs each way



* We've made 870 _win only_ bets, on which we've made a profit of €NA. 
* We've made 110 _each way_ bets, on which we've made a profit of €730.


# Unmatched Bets



We'll consider only win only bets (and not each way bets) in this section.

Of the bets that have been matched, there have been 159 winners and 695 losers. That means that 19% of matched bets have been winners. Of the bets that have not been matched, there have been 14 winners and 67 losers. That means that 17% of unmatched bets have been winners. Unmatched bets have saved us 71 points on losers but cost us 85 on winners, whereas getting better odds on posted bets which were matched has made us 73 points (where I have assumed that when we post, we get 20% better odds than if we'd just taken best available at the time). So overall, choosing to post when we do (rather than taking the bad bbest available odds) has saved us 59 points.


# Summary



We've made a gross profit of €NA and paid €3,308 in subscription fees, so our net profit is €NA.

* Rory has a 44% share of the investment, therefore his net profit is €NA.
* Aidan has a 44% share of the investment, therefore his net profit is €NA.
* John has a 11% share of the investment, therefore his net profit is €NA.
